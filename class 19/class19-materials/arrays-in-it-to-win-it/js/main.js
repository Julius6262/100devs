//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let ar = ["mov1", "mov2", "mov3"]
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let mov1 = ar[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let len = ar.length
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let las = ar[ar.length -1]
